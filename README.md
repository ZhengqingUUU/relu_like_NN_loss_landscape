## Loss Landscape of Shallow ReLU-like Neural Networks: Stationary Points, Saddle Escaping, and Network Embedding

![](an_illustration.jpg)

This repository reproduces the numerical results from the paper: [Loss Landscape of Shallow ReLU-like Neural Networks: Stationary Points, Saddle Escape, and Network Embedding](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ogKE7LcvW6).

### Usage

(1) Install `python 3.10`.

(2) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

(3) The three notebooks, whose names are indicative of the setups, reproduces the three numerical experiments in the paper. Each takes a few minutes to run.
